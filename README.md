🚀 Token-Sender
Token-Sender is a decentralized application (dApp) that allows users to send ERC-20 tokens securely on the Ethereum network via a simple and intuitive frontend interface. Built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, RainbowKit, and WAGMI, the app connects seamlessly to Web3 wallets and enables token transfers directly on-chain.

This project showcases how to build a full-stack dApp with wallet integration, contract interaction, and gas-efficient transactions, ideal for learning or demonstrating Ethereum token transfers using modern Web3 tools.
